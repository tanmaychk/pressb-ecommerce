## What did i learn
going into the project i had no prior knowledge of react , although the project has shown me the jist of why people hype around react i still have much more to learn about it.This being my first kind of medium size development i followed JSM to some extent but as the video is over a year old so were the packages and dependencies that the site was intially working on so i had to figure out sometimes to work around some errors and as a result i now know how good one has to be error handling and managment.
I had a lot of fun making this project, although it took me a month to follow and make this app i would like to add additionaly add extra features and make updates to the basic looking UI.
